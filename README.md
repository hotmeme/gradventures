# Purpose

Epic documentation of all our adventures and history.  

I used an Astro template to begin constructing this website. I retain some of its documentation here.  

# Astro Sphere Theme Documentation

Astro Sphere is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme based on my personal website.

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components.
