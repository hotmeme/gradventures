On our second adventure into the space, we made a new type of art.   
This happened on the dunes, and although it had no physical form in our space, it was beautiful.   
Art was made of our minds, between them. It was a beautiful symphony they played together.   

To give it any more form than that would only serve to mislead the interpreting reader.
