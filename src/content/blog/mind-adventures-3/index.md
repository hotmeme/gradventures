Our final trip to the space before Ryan must depart for pilot training.  
This one was just us. And it was just as powerful as you would expect.  

The day actually started later than expected, at 1:07 pm.  
We went into the photolab to make some final prints for Ryan.  

Amazing day outside.  
Entered the O in the oval. For the first time, entirely in public.  

We discovered sit.  
Our orbits are locked from this point forward.  

We decided that we would keep things going great. No matter the difficulty.
