The day has come for Ryan to leave Stanford and move on to the next chapter.  

Garrett spends the morning and early afternoon ***grinding*** on the website.  
The website is finally finished, and given a little extra time, Garrett makes his goodbye video letter to Ryan.  

Delivery of the goodbye gifts to Ryan in his apartment.  
The Peak Design camera strap and Braun alarm clock are granted.  
The two share a very nice time looking through the website and all the things they did.  
The goodbye letter video is watched. Some good words are exchanged.  

Garrett sees Ryan off to his car where his dad is waiting.  
Andrew Xue pulls up. Everyone says goodbye.  
Andrew and Garrett stand there watching the car drive away as Ryan sneaks in one more video of them waving goodbye.  
The car drives away and Ryan is gone.  
Garrett deals with it.
