Camping with the tiger, the crow, and the bear. 

There once was a time in which the animals camped together under the unity of Rains.  

One was the bear: big, and maw-y.  
The tiger was sexual and constantly full of lust.  
The crow was loud and squawked.

Garrett is the Dolphin – always needing of social interaction.
Ryan is the housecat – a little prissy and gets what he wants.
