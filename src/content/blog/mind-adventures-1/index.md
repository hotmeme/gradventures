Our very first trip to the space together.  
What a beautiful place. Really *beautiful*.  
There is nothing that compares to it.  
We went with Isa Dula.  

This day really started with laying out in the grass of the Frongard / Beachtown Courtyard, staring up at the clouds.  
We constructed a language to describe what we felt.  
- Bruerwin  
The feeling of bliss and gratefulness for being in the space
- Yuppeda  
Acceptance that we cannot bring most things back   
- The O  
Entering a shared space together. Melding into one.  
- Mos  
Understanding how our experience in the O connects us to everything else in the space

We played guitar, and listened to the overtones on the low frequencies ringing out freely.  
We played the feedback from the electric guitar and amp.  
We went to Alex Esclamado's BBQ and chatted with people.  
We went to the sculpture garden and sat with the thinker.  
We went to the Andrew Bird concert at Frost, and the nice ticket lady offered to let Ryan in for free, saying she was surprised that we already had two tickets for Garrett and Isa.  
We returned to my apartment, entered the O again, and chatted about life, existence, and our relationship.  
We called it a night around 12:15am, and Garrett went to SF for a house-rave. Ryan had scuba certification in the morning.
