> Happy one year anniversary.

\- Ryan

We are **so** back.  
Finally we revolved around the sun and made it back to paradise.  

Honestly spent a ton of the festival together.  
Pulled up with an absolutely *elite* crew as well:  
- Spark Wu
- Brandon Kim
- Anna Gruzas
- Nate Lim
- Pierre Feran  

with frequent guest appearances from Yeon Jun Kim.

Two car camping spots butted up to each other with a Stanford shade canopy, a 9 person tent, 2 small tents (for Spark and Anna) and all of Ryan's camping stuff he left at Stanford.  
It was a delight.  

Sets we went insane at together include:
- Grimes
- LE SSERAFIM
- ATARASHII GAKKO!
- Marc Rebillet (Do Not Lab edition)
- Jockstrap
- Juicewon (I wish)
- ATEEZ (everyone wishes)

Garrett's top set was Clown Core. Ryan idk.  

Tried to make friends with an asian frog-tattoed girl at the DoLab. Failed.  
Did make friends with some Random frat guy waiting for Anyma (which was mid).  

Drank some new tea and ate the leaves but it didn't hit like we thought it would.  
Made hella shin ramen and caaaansss and PB&J.  

**Day 4**   
Scavenging.  
2am run to collect discarded camping equipment.  
Acquired a nice A frame tent, camping chair, and cooler.  

Dropped off Ryan and Pierre at a Koreatown restaurant in LA before they went to LAX.
