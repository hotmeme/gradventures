Our second trip to the space together.  
This one was very different.  

We were on the dunes, just us two, surrounded by the others.  
It was cold and a little windy that night.  

We stared up at the stars and spent a good chunk of the night pointing out patterns to each other, and helping each other to see what each of us saw.  
We really dove into our writing of the SitCom. Our best story involves an asian girl who paints her nails every night
and gets mad at herself in the morning for falling asleep late.
